# AI-Based-Skin-Disease-Diagnosis-and-Prediction-System(Working)
This AI-powered system aims to assist in diagnosing and predicting skin diseases such as viral, fungal, and allergic conditions. By using image analysis and symptom data, the system provides early detection, reliable diagnoses, and treatment recommendations. The goal is to bridge healthcare access gaps, particularly in regions with limited access to specialized medical professionals.

Features
Image-Based Diagnosis: Upload an image of the affected skin, and the AI model will analyze and classify the disease (viral).
Symptom Input: Users can enter additional symptoms to improve diagnosis accuracy.
Early Detection: The system is optimized for detecting diseases at an early stage.
Treatment Recommendations: Provides general advice and treatment suggestions based on the diagnosed condition.
User-Friendly Interface: An intuitive UI for both patients and healthcare providers to easily interact with the system.
Technology Stack
Frontend: Developed using React.js for a responsive and dynamic user interface.
Backend: Powered by Django for API handling and business logic.
AI Model: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) implemented in TensorFlow or PyTorch for image analysis and disease classification.
Database: MongoDB for storing user data and image history.
Deployment: The project is deployed using Heroku or AWS.
How It Works
Upload an Image: The user uploads an image of the affected skin area.
Symptom Input: The user can provide additional symptoms like itchiness, redness, or swelling.
AI Diagnosis: The AI model processes the image and symptom data, identifying the type of skin disease.
Prediction and Recommendation: The system predicts the likelihood of different skin conditions and offers preliminary treatment advice.
